Functions of html pages:
The function of index.html is to give more information (some random information) about me and give the user enough information to contact me.

The function of Previous_Projects.html is to provide the name of each project that I have used and provide a link to each project so that the user can get more information about it. It also provides my resume at the bottom of my page for employers.
